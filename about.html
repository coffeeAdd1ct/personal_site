        I was born in Waco, Texas on February 17th, 1990 to Joy and Tommy Billeaud.
        <br><br>
        As a child I was very inquisitive and a lover of books. When the internet began to catch up with the possibilities in the late 90s, I started to teach myself how to code. My first projects were just small bash scripts, playing around on our home computer, and I probably broke that old computer more than my father cares to admit(he had to fix it).
        <br><br>
        Later, I began learning the basic computing language that my TI-83 calculator, creating programs to assist myself with mathamatical formulae. This was the real beginning of my self-education days.
